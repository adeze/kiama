Any Scala reference value can have attributes defined for it using
Kiama.

Rewriting is more problematic because Kiama needs to have access to
the components of a value in order to be able to rewrite it in a
generic fashion. Kiama has built-in support for rewriting of `Product`
values (see [CaseClasses](CaseClasses.md)), and `GenTraversable` or `Map` collections
(see [Collections](Collections.md)), since the Scala library provides mechanisms for
accessing their components.

You can make other types of value rewritable by having them implement
Kiama's `Rewritable` trait.

```
trait Rewritable {
    import Rewriter.Term

    def arity : Int
    def deconstruct : Seq[Term]

    def reconstruct (components : Array[Term]) : Term
    protected def illegalArgs (desc : String, argtypes : String, args : Array[Term])
}
```

(`Rewriter.Term` is `Any` in the current version of Kiama.)

A `Rewritable` value must provide a way of deconstructing itself using
the `arity` method, that returns the number of children that the value
has, and the `deconstruct` method, that returns a sequence of those
children.

The `reconstruct` method is used to build a new value that is the same
as the receiver, except that its children are replaced by those in the
`components` array.  If `reconstruct` cannot accept the `components`
for some reason (e.g., wrong number or type), the `illegalArgs` method
should be called.  By default, `illegalArgs` throws an `illegalArgumentException`.

See Kiama's `imperative` example (file
[ASTNonCase.scala](https://code.google.com/p/kiama/source/browse/library/src/org/kiama/example/imperative/ASTNonCase.scala))
for an example of how to define `Rewritable` instances.
