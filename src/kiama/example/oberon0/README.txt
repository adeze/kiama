This directory contains a Kiama rendition of the Oberon-0
implementation described in Niklaus Wirth's book Compiler Construction
(Addison-Wesley, 1996). The full text of the book and Wirth's original
code can be obtained from

   http://www.cs.inf.ethz.ch/~wirth/books/CompilerConstruction/

The main program here is a driver for the three main components of
the implementation.

compiler:

A compiler from Oberon-0 to a simple RISC machine. In Wirth's book the
compiler generates object code directly, whereas we generate assembly
language which is translated to object code by a separate assembler.

assembler:

The assembler for the simple RISC architecture. Given an assembly
language program, the assembler produces object code.

machine:

An implementation of the simple RISC architecture. This program runs
object produced by the assembler.
