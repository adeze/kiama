This example implements Java, Java compilation and Java Virtual
Machine specifications based on the Abstract State Machine
presentation in "Java and the Java Virtual Machine: Definition,
Verification and Validation" by Robert Stärk, Joachim Schmid and Egon
Börger, Springer, 2001.

Notes on differences:

- The original uses one universe PrimOp for all primitive operations.
  To be more type safe this version distinguishes between primitives
  that leave their result on the stack (which return a list) and those
  that return a Boolean value. The latter is represented by the
  BoolPrimOp type.
