/**
 * Kiama is a library of internal domain-specific languages for software
 * language engineering. It's main components address tree decoration via
 * attribute grammars (package `attribution`), tree transformation via
 * strategic term rewriting (package `rewriting`), dynamic semantics
 * (package `machine`) and pretty-printing (package `output`).
 *
 * The `util` package contains support modules for parsing,  input/output,
 * read-eval-print loops (REPLs) and pattern matching.
 *
 * The `examples` package (available as part of the Kiama tests) contains
 * many examples of using Kiama to solve small to medium language processing
 * problems.
