1. Kiama

Kiama is a Scala library for language processing.  In the Kiama project we are
investigating embedding of language processing formalisms such as grammars,
parsers, rewriters and analysers into general-purpose programming languages.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Kiama is a research project, it's early days and the code is
undergoing heavy development, so many details will change.  Consult with us
before you rely on it for serious work.  We make no guarantees about the
features or performance of the Kiama library if you do choose to use it.

3. Documentation and mailing lists

The main documentation for Kiama takes the form of wiki pages
covering library features and examples, available at the Google
Code site.  The User Manual page is a good place to start:

on other software and links to API documentation, see the Releases
wiki page:

Kiama is currently concentrating on incorporating existing language processing
formalisms, so credit goes to the original developers of those formalisms.  See
the code for details of the sources of ideas that come from elsewhere.

Many of the library rewriting strategies are based on the Stratego library.
