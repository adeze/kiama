It is necessary to have a tree representation of the data that is
to be manipulated in order to use Kiama's facilities. This
representation is usually an _abstract syntax tree_ (AST) that
encodes the structure of a program written in some language, but
the tree could represent any hierarchical data.

There are currently two convenient methods for building tree
structured representations for use with Kiama: using the Scala parser
combinator library and using the separate
[Rats! parser generator](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/rats.html). For
documentation on how to use Rats! with Scala, please see the
[sbt-rats](http://sbt-rats.googlecode.com) project and the Rats!
documentation. For simplicity, the remainder of this documentation
focuses on combinator-based parsing.

_Combinator-based parsing_ is common in languages such as Haskell and ML
in packages such as
[Parsec](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html). The
basic idea of combinator parsing is to write expressions that look
like the context-free grammar productions of the language that is to be parsed. The
value of an expression is a parsing object that can be
applied to a specific input source. The result of that application is
either an indication of parsing success and possibly a value
representing the parsed text, or an indication of failure and a
failure message.

Detailed documentation for the parsing library may be found in its
[API documentation](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/api/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.html).
Chapter 31 of
[Programming in Scala](http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala)
provides an excellent overview of both using the library and its (non-packrat)
implementation. This chapter from the first edition of the book is freely
[available](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combinator-parsing.html).

More detailed information on using the parsing library with Kiama can be
found in these pages:
